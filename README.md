# 30DaysofCode

This challenge is known as 30 days of code. at the end of readings and practices, we hope that the student is creating small programs and having understanding of the codes typed.
For this project, guided missions were created, that is, a step-by-step guide of what should be done, always commented and detailed. 
These missions were written taking into account that the student performs at least one per day in the proposed order. 
Dedication time per mission varies from person to person per person, but solutions take an average of 20 minutes.
